# Data wrangling for business analysis

Overview:
This project involves creating Python functions to manipulate and analyze datasets for business purposes. The key capabilities include:

Analyzing a baseball statistics dataset:
Calculate new metrics like on-base percentage
Split data by league
Identify career records like the highest on-base percentage
Consolidating sample data from multiple files
Automate combining dispersed boiler sample data
Separate combined data into test and control groups
Restructuring sample data
Transform sample data from multiple rows per sample into one row per sample format.
Extracting coordinate data
Parse coordinate strings and convert them to numeric latitude and longitude
Analyzing text data
Profile characteristics of a corpus of words, including length statistics

Business Implications:

Improved analysis of baseball statistics could help teams evaluate players more accurately as potential additions to their rosters.
Consolidating dispersed sample data allows more robust analysis with increased statistical power.
Restructuring data is essential for many analysis techniques
Extracting embedded data saves time and enables geospatial analysis
Text analytics facilitates search, sentiment analysis, document classification, and more
These data manipulation capabilities allow data scientists to prepare datasets for business analytics and decision making rapidly. The functions created provide reusable tools for future analytics projects.
